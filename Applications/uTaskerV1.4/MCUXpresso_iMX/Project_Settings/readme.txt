iMX uses only MCUXpresso.

To work with the MCUXpresso for iMX, delete any original Eclipse project files at the top of the project directory. Then copy the ones in this folder to that location, import into MCUXpresso.
Update the copy of the project files here if needed so that they can later be restored when working with the project again, after having changed to a different IDE in the meantime.
