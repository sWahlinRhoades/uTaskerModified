You can choose from two fixed projects ("Blinky" and "Hello, World!") which are intended as very simple checks of the build and its operation.
Note however that the Blinky project can always be set manually in config.h by uncommenting the define BLINKY, which then overrides all other settings. Also note that "Hello, World!" also includes a Blinky function.
Finally note that any project with SERIAL_INTERFACE, USE_USB_CDC or USE_TELNET support will automatically have the "Hello, World!" fuctionality and optionally (if USE_MAINTENANCE hasn't been commented out) command line interface (CLI) functionality on the UART, USB-CDC and/or Telnet connections.
